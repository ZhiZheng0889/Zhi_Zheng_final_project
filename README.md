This repository showcases projects from the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course, highlighting my skills in creating meaningful visual narratives from complex datasets.

## Project Overview

### Project 01: Interstate 94 Traffic Analysis

Located in the `project_01/` folder, this analysis examines how weather conditions and time of day influence traffic volume on Interstate 94 Westbound in Minnesota. The project employs various visualization techniques to reveal and understand traffic patterns, crucial for proposing solutions to enhance traffic management and safety.

**Featured Visualization:**
- **Violin Plot of Traffic Volume by Weather:** This plot illustrates the impact of weather conditions on traffic volumes, enabling dynamic exploration through its interactive features.

### Project 02: Florida Lakes Geographical Analysis

This analysis, stored in the `project_02/` folder, focuses on the spatial distribution of Florida lakes. Using linear regression, I predicted lake areas from their perimeters, providing insights into lake size variations and their proximity to urban areas. This project includes comprehensive data preparation, regression analysis, and both static and interactive visualizations.

**Featured Visualization:**
- **Florida Lakes Spatial Visualization:** Maps categorizing lakes by size and showcasing their distribution with detailed geographical context.

### Project 03: Weather and Academic Feedback Visualization

This project involves analyzing weather data from Tampa International Airport and RateMyProfessors comments from 2022. It aims to extract and visually interpret patterns that provide insights into weather trends and academic feedback.

**Featured Visualization:**
- **Network Visualization of Commonly Used Terms:** Highlights the connections between terms in RateMyProfessors comments, shedding light on dominant themes and sentiments.

### Moving Forward

The course has significantly enhanced my ability to utilize visual design in data storytelling effectively. I have learned the power of theme customization, including color schemes and text positioning, to make visualizations more engaging and informative, whether presented live or through digital platforms.

I am eager to further refine my skills in creating interactive visuals that adapt to real-time data and user interactions. My goal is to blend aesthetic sensibility with technical proficiency to produce visuals that are not only appealing but also drive informed decisions across various scenarios.
